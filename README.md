# GeneralizedCouponCollectorWithoutReplacement
Running simulations to confirm derivations of expectation for the generalized coupon collector without replacement problem.

Question: Given an urn with balls of n different colors, and b_1, b_2, ... , b_n balls of each color, what is the expected number of draws required before seeing k of the n colors?

Here, I run Python simulations to confirm my analytical derivations of the solution to this problem. I've put my math and thought process on my website, ishaanchawla.com.
